## Overview ‚ÑπÔ∏è:
- This repository contains the group solution for the Group Project: A compact Java solver that discovers a hidden secret code (length 1‚Äì18) using a method guess(String).
- Problem Overview:
You forgot the secret code that encrypts your notes. The code is an unknown-length string made only from the letters B, A, C, X, I, U. You can submit guesses and receive feedback: for any guess of the correct length the function returns the number of characters that are correct and in the correct position (if your guess length is wrong it returns a special value). Your task is to first infer the true length, then recover the entire secret string while minimizing the number of calls to the feedback function. The main challenge is that the length is unknown and every extra guess counts toward the algorithm‚Äôs performance.
